🔥 Europe Just Hit Record Russian LNG Imports—Right Before Banning It 
💡 In January 2026, the EU imported 2.276 billion cubic meters of Russian LNG, the highest volume ever recorded. The twist? Just weeks earlier, Brussels formally approved a complete ban on Russian LNG starting January 2027. While European officials draw red lines on paper, energy realities tell a different story. Russia remains a critical supplier as Europe scrambles for alternatives, with total LNG imports up 6% year-over-year. 
⚡ Can Europe really quit Russian energy, or is this ban just political theater that'll crash against economic reality?
